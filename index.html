      <h3>Education</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Bill was a voracious reader as a child, spending many hours poring over reference books such as the encyclopedia. Around the age of 11 
        or 12, Bill's parents began to have concerns about his behavior. He was doing well in school.

      <h4>Team work</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">
        At Lakeside School Gates met Paul Allen, who was two years his senior. The pair became fast friends, bonding over their common 
        enthusiasm for computers, even though they were very different people. Allen was more reserved and shy. Bill was feisty and at times 
        combative.

      <h5>Gate and Melinda Gates Foundation</h5>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), also known as the Gates Foundation, is a private foundation founded by Bill and Melinda Gates. 
        It was launched in 2000, and is said to be the largest private foundation in the US, holding $38 billion in assets. The primary aims of 
        the foundation are, globally, to enhance healthcare and reduce extreme poverty, and in America, to expand educational opportunities and 
        access to information technology. The foundation, based in Seattle, Washington, is controlled by its three trustees: Bill and Melinda 
        Gates, and Warren Buffett. Other principal officers include Co-Chair William H. Gates, Sr. and Chief Executive Officer Susan Hellmann.
